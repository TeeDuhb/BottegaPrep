# BottegaPrep
This project came from my first exploration into DevCamps. I knew I wanted to be a developer, but I had just barely scratched the surface of what was possible and still had almost no idea what I was doing (mostly). I'm very pleased with the way it started turning out, I'm not sure if I can use their instructions to finish it without having to enroll in the class, so I moved on.
